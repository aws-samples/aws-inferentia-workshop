# aws-inferentia-workshop


## Overview

This repository contains labs and instructions for deploying ML models on [AWS inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/) instances using EC2 and [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). AWS inferentia instances provide signficant cost/performance benefits compared to other GPU instances while performing inference on large and complex models requiring GPU.



## Getting started

This repository has two sections:

- Inferentia on EC2
- Inferentia on SageMaker


You can choose to complete either or both of the sections. The sections contain further detailed instructions to complete the labs.
